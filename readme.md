## What is this?

Trassel is a JavaScript graph computing tool.

Trassel is built with simplicity in mind, enabling engineers who may not be familiar with graph theory to easily implement powerful visualization and analytics tools in their applications and backends. 

Trassel consists of a data manager that allows you to control what subset of your data is exposed at any given time, a customizable and expandable layout engine, a WebGL powered renderer, as well as a number of utilities like community detection and path finding. The library can be used both for data exploration as well as for powering advanced visualizations.
